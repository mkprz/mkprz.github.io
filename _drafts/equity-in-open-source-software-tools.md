title: equity in open source software tools
---

this weekend was the third Central Texas Barcamp here in San Antonio. the theme was equity, diversity, and inclusion in art and technology. we had a great turnout and lots of great discussions on fandom, voter turnout, and the Interaction Age.

unfortunately, the event ran long so the last four sessions didn't happen. that included my talk on equity in open source tools. so I'll use this as an excuse to finally write something up on my bakshi project.
