Anonymous feedback from audience

1. pause when you are moving from sentence to sentence.
   Once you remove filler, you can then close the gap of your pauses.
   But try the pause anytime you fell like saying UM or AH.
   Great content. Nice facts!
2. Very original topic. Now im hungry.
 - try note cards next time to free your hands
 - i can tell you have done your research on this
3. Good start with a question. You know what you are talking about.
 - Make effort to not hold paper notes
 - a little more rehearsal would help alot
4. Opening question dangerous - but you did well
