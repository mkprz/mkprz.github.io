## Stay on Target

This is my attempt at a mantra. Some of you will recognize it as a phrase from Star Wars. And already I'm off-topic. I get distracted easily. But when I do focus, I have been able to get the job done. Focusing means not having to research every detail of each step in the process. It doesn't have to be perfect. Just get it done. You can always do iterations.

This blog will mostly discuss software but I will also discuss other things in my life. Afterall, I am more than just a software engineer.
