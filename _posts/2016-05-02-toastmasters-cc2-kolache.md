# Public speaking and Leadership

I joined a local chapter of Toastmasters in March and am about to prepare for the 2nd speech in my Competent Communicator manual. Sounds very boy scout-ish, no? The club I joined is a Distinguished Presidents club -- meaning the club is composed of several advanced communicators and leaders. Yes, there is also a leadership track in addition to the communication track.
It's actually very engaging and the manuals are there as guides and not so much as rigid textbooks.

the first speech was an ice breaker and the manual focused on me having an introduction, a body, and a conclusion. this second speech is focused on organizing the speech.

I have made outlines all my life, for reports, pseudocode, to-do lists, etc. but I have not given much thought to them to think of them as having categories. the CC manual describes several: chronological, spatial, causal, comparative, topical, problem-solution.

A chronological outline is something you might do for a history report. The topical outline, breaking down a topic into subtopics, is something you might do for describing a system architecture.

A spatial outline is how one might describe physical architecture or the geometry of a physical object, by starting on one end and progressing in one direction towards the other end. You might describe the ground floor, the mezzanine, the main floors, and finally the top level, in that order, or the levels of a garden with ground cover, small plants and finally vines and plants providing shade to the whole garden, the canopy.

With a comparative outline, one is appealing to an audience to take one side over the other. while a causal outline is used to explain cause and effect as in chemical reactions or maybe as with user interfaces.

finally, a problem-solution outline is used to describe a problem and then reveal a solution. Many infomercial scripts could have been outlined using this method.

my topic is the origin of the Texas kolche. I believe I have a choice of several outline types here. I could do a chronological, topical, or a spatial outline. I could organize my speech historically with a chronological outline of how the food was developed. with a spatial out line, i might group those evolutionary variations by geographic region from Europe to central Texas. and with a topical outline I could organize the speech by the variations themselves. I could probably also do a hybrid of all three, where chronological is topmost organization, spatial is secondary, and topical is the last in the hierarchy.


However, since I only have 7 minutes max for my speech, I'm going to keep it simple. I'll do a spatial outline with a loose grasp for chronology.
